# springboot-demo

While searching for a good starting point to create a springboot application, I noticed I liked and disliked parts of multiple demo-projects.

I merged logic from multiple demos into 1 demo which (for me) made into a good reference project.

The stuff this demo uses:

- springboot v2.0.5 
- an in-memory-DB (H2) which can be used during development/testing
- springboot security with 2 example-users
- thymeleaf with 
  - the thymeleaf-security extension with some examples
  - the thymleaf-layout-dialect in order to reuse components
- webjars in order to manage javascript and css (including webjars-locate)
- a bootstrap 4 responsive navbar
- font awesome 5
- jquery
