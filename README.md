# About this application

While searching for a good starting point to create my first springboot application, I noticed I liked and disliked parts of multiple demo-projects.

I merged logic from multiple demos into 1 demo which (for me) made into a good reference project.

# Prerequisites
JDK 8

- springboot v2.0.5 
- an in-memory-DB (H2) which can be used during development/testing
